React Template
==============

Start a new react project super quick. Run `npm install` from the project's root directory then set the output path in `webpack.config.js` and you're good to go! The webpack dev server can be started in hotload mode with `npm start`. The app is served out of `localhost:2112`.

If webpack gives you any flak about node (even if you have node installed) run `apt install nodejs-legacy`
